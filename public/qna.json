        "question": "How react js works?",
        "answer": "React work using virtual dom. JavaScript has to power to change dom. But react make 2 different type of dom. Actual dom and Virtual dom. React basically maintains a tree. This tree is able to do efficient diff computations on the actual dom and virtual dom. React allows to effectively re-construct the  DOM in JavaScript and push only those changes to the DOM which have actually occurred. React also use JSX to make its work easily. There's nothing like JSX - neither to JavaScript, nor to the browser. JSX is simply syntactic sugar for creating very specific JavaScript objects."
